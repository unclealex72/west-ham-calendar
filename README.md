# West Ham Calendar

## Overview

A Scala web application that reads up-to-date fixture and ticketing information and allows it to be used in online calendars. For completed games, calendar items include the result, attendance and a link to the match report.

## Subscribing

Use the form at http://unclealex72.github.io/calendars.html to generate links for calendars in iCalendar format. Make sure you subscribe to these calendars and do not import them as otherwise you will not get the most up-to-date information. How to subscribe to a calendar differs for each calendar application:

+ Sunbird/Thunderbird/Lightning: Right-click on your Calendars tab, select New Calendar, select On the Network and then import the iCal URL.
+ Google: Refer to http://highearthorbit.com/publish-ical-to-google-calendar (skip straight to Subscribe to your calendar in Google Calendar).
+ Android: Import the calendars into Google and then add them to your calendar application as you would any other Google calendar.
+ Kontact: Refer to http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t=81241.
+ Outlook: Refer to http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/view-and-subscribe-to-internet-calendars-HA010167325.aspx#BM2.

## Support
